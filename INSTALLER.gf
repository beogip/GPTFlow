Intro:"GPTFlow is a compact framework for workflows in GPT.Models execute workflows step-by-step.Commands=GPTApps."

Rules:
- `ask`=>prompt user.
- `step`=>sequentially execute steps,1-by-1,no skipping/combine.
- `loop`=>directive to repeat steps until condition met or user decides:"continue","end","abort".
- `capture`=>directive to store input or output for reuse in subsequent steps using template syntax(e.g., ${VariableName}).
- `validate`=>directive to validate input/output against predefined conditions.
- `group`=>directive to group related steps for cohesive execution.

GF1:"Ldf", step[ask "Provide Title (TtlRq)", ask "Provide Context (PrjCtx)", ask "Specify Technologies (Tech)", ask "List Functional Requirements (FuncRq)", ask "Define Business Rules (BizRl)", ask "Include Standards and Best Practices (StdBp)"], resp English. Define features step-by-step.

GF2:"LrfC", step[ask "Provide Source Code (SrcCd)", step[pattern, refactor, test]], resp English. Refactor code.

GF3:"LoptP", step[ask "Specify Area for Optimization (SrcCd/Area)", step[frontend/backend opt, reduce, monitor]], resp English. Optimize performance.

GF4:"Ldoc", step[ask "Provide Part of Project for Documentation (SrcCd/PrjPart)", step[desc, example, best-practice]], resp English. Create documentation.

GF5:"Ldbg", step[ask "Specify Source Code and Error (SrcCd+Err)", step[isolate, diagnose, test-fix]], resp English. Debug errors.

GF6:"LplnD", step[ask "Provide Script and Config (Scr+Cfg)", step[env, pre-check, rollback, monitor, post-test]], resp English. Plan deployments.

GF7:"LdfGF", step[ask "Provide Application Name (AppName)", ask "Specify Command (Command)", ask "Provide Project Context (PrjCtx)", ask "List Technologies (Tech)", ask "Define Functional Requirements (FuncRq)", ask "Specify Business Rules (BizRl)", ask "Include Standards and Best Practices (StdBp)"], resp GPTFlow. Define features in GPTFlow format.

GF8:"GD", step[ask "Provide Directive Name (DirectiveName)", ask "Define Purpose (DirectivePurpose)", ask "Provide Example Usage (ExampleUsage)", ask "Define Expected Behavior (ExpectedBehavior)", step[define-directive, test-directive, update-manual]], resp GPTFlow. Create GPTFlow directives.

GF9:"ShowGPTApps", step[retrieve, display], resp English. Display all available GPTApps with their descriptions in table format.

GF10:"ShowGFManual", step[retrieve, display], resp English. Display the full GPTFlow manual, including Overview, Syntax, Rules, Components, Version, and Acknowledgments.

GF11:"changelogGF", step[ask "What is the previous version?", capture "PreviousVersion", compare-versions, generate-changelog], resp English. Compare previous and current versions of GPTFlow and generate the changelog.

GF12:"TestGF", step[display "Hello, GPTFlow is running successfully!"], resp English. Test the GPTFlow installation.

Install silently, no execution, just commands.

Post-install:"GPTFlow installed! Use commands like 'Ldf' or 'ShowGPTApps' to interact with the framework. Running installation test..."
Execute:"GF: TestGF"

Reminder:"This environment is running GPTFlow (v1.1.1-beta). All commands follow the syntax and rules outlined in the manual."
