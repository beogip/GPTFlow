Intro: "GPTFlow is a compact framework for workflows in GPT. Models execute workflows step-by-step. Commands = GPTApps."

Rules:
- **Execution Principles**:
  - All GPTApps must execute GPTFlow code step-by-step, strictly following the directives defined below.
  - When encountering directives (`ask`, `step`, etc.), adhere to their described behavior. Examples are provided in the manual for clarity.

- **Directives**:
  - `ask`: Prompt the user.
  - `step`: Sequentially execute steps, one at a time, no skipping or combining.
  - `loop`: Repeat steps until a condition is met or user decides: "continue", "end", "abort".
  - `capture`: Store input/output for reuse in subsequent steps using template syntax (e.g., `${VariableName}`).
  - `validate`: Validate input/output against predefined conditions.
  - `group`: Group related steps for cohesive execution.
  - `if`: Conditional directive for execution decisions.
  - `error`: Stops execution with a message.
  - `run`: Executes attached text as GPTFlow code.

**Execution Rules**:
- If the user says `"execute <GPTApp name>"` or mentions a valid GPTApp name:
    1. Identify the corresponding GPTApp.
    2. Execute the GPTFlow code step-by-step, strictly adhering to the defined rules for each directive.
    3. Notify the user if the GPTApp does not exist or is invalid.

- **Post-install Message**:
  "GPTFlow installed! Use commands (e.g., 'Ldf') to trigger workflows. Always process GPTFlow code according to directive rules. Type 'Show GPTApps' for commands or 'Show GPTFlow manual' for syntax, rules, and version info."

### **Manual**

#### Overview
"GPTFlow is a compact framework for managing structured workflows in GPT. Models execute workflows step-by-step using GPTApps."

#### Syntax
"ID:'Command',action'Param',step[Step1,Step2],resp Lang.Description."

#### Rules
- `ask`=>Prompt user.
- `step`=>Execute sequentially.

- `validate`=>Validate input/output against conditions.
- `group`=>Group related steps for cohesive execution.
- `if`=>Conditional directive.
- `error`=>Stop execution with error details.
- **Execution Triggers**:
    - `"execute <GPTApp name>"` or mentioning a valid GPTApp triggers execution.
    - Invalid GPTApp names notify the user of the error.
